# FONTAINE_DECAL

The objective of this project is to remove the manual decal measurement process by designing an automatic projection system that uses computer vision to digitally project an arrangement of decals onto truck doors. The proposed solution is to develop a computer-vision-guided projection system capable of detecting truck door geometry, computing decal placement coordinates, and projecting decal layouts in real time.
