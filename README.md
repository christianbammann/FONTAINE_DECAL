# FONTAINE_DECAL - Senior Design II

The objective of this project is to remove the manual decal measurement process by designing an automatic projection system that uses computer vision to digitally project an arrangement of decals onto truck doors. The proposed solution is to develop a computer-vision-guided projection system capable of detecting truck door geometry, computing decal placement coordinates, and projecting decal layouts in real time. The design will be mounted on a mobile cart and consist of three main components: a projector, a camera, and a microcomputer. The system must meet specific performance, safety, and reliability requirements outlined in this document to ensure proper operation in garage and shop environments. At the end of this project, Fontaine Modification requires a functional design demonstrating the automated decal projection system is feasible in their production environment, along with a complete documentation package that would allow an unassociated party to build additional units.
